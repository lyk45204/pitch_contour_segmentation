# pitch_contour_segmentation

Creating a README file for your MATLAB project is an excellent way to document and explain your code for others (or even for yourself at a later date). Given the nature of your project, which involves segmenting pitch contours using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and a variety of sophisticated techniques, it's important to provide a clear and detailed README. Here's a template you can use, which you might need to adjust according to your specific project structure and contents.

# Pitch Contour Segmentation using HMM

## Overview
This MATLAB project automatically segments pitch contours into three types of regions: transitory, steady, and modulation. The segmentation is performed using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). The approach involves analyzing pitch contours at a quantum level, defined as regions bordered by two local extremes of the pitch contour.

## Features
- **Quantum-Level Analysis**: Each quantum is characterized by its duration and extent.
- **Observation Likelihood Distribution**: Smoothed using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE).
- **Optimization**: Bandwidth of KDE is optimized using K-fold cross-validation.

## Dependencies
- MATLAB (Version XX or later)
- [List any external libraries or toolboxes used, if any]

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd [project-directory]
   ```

## Usage
1. Load your pitch contour data into MATLAB.
2. Run the main segmentation script (replace `[script_name]` with the actual script name):
   ```matlab
   [script_name]
   ```

## Data Format
Describe the expected data format for the pitch contour input.

## Training Method
The model is trained using a supervised approach. Training data should be prepared as follows:
